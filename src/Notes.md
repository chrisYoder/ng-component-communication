## Passing the reference of one component to another
    - Property Binding
        - the primary way of binding data in Angular. 
        - syntax: [property]
        - binds data to a property of an element
          - see example 1
          - when you change the bound property (id in my example) then it automatically updates the view
        - can also be used to pass data to a components
          - see example 2
